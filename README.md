# sql-challenge-
This challenge has not really been so difficult but because I missed at least one session, it took the help of my colleagues, TA, Instructor and the help of CheatGPT to get my challenge completed. 
After going through some the the recorded lessons, I was able to understand most of the work like importing and exporting CSV files and creating schema. I was also able to understand the concept of primary and foreign keys.
